<h3 class="label">CHAPTER I</h3>
<h3 class="main">My Birth and Earliest Years in Kalamba</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I was born on Wednesday, the nineteenth of June,
1861. It was a few days before the full of the moon. I found myself in
a village. I had some slight notions of the morning sun and of my
parents. That is as much as I can recall of my baby days.</p>
<p class="par">The training which I received from my earliest infancy
is perhaps what formed my habits. I can recall clearly my first gloomy
nights, passed on the azotea of our house. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e793" href="#xd21e793" name=
"xd21e793">14</a>]</span>They seem as yesterday! They were nights
filled with the poetry of sadness and seem near now because at present
my days are so sad. On moonlight nights, I took my supper on the
azotea. My nurse, who was very fond of me, used to threaten to leave me
to a terrible but imaginary being like the bogey of the Europeans if I
did not eat.</p>
<p class="par">I had nine sisters and a brother. Our father was a model
parent. He gave us the education which was suitable in a family neither
rich nor poor. He was thrifty. By careful saving, he was able to build
a stone house. He also bought another house; and he put up a nipa
cottage on our plot of irrigated ground. The cottage was shaded by
bananas and trees.</p>
<p class="par">At nightfall, my mother had us all say our prayers
together. Then we would go to the azotea or to a window to enjoy the
moonlight; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e799" href="#xd21e799"
name="xd21e799">15</a>]</span>and my nurse would tell us stories.
Sometimes sad and sometimes gay, nurse&rsquo;s stories were always
oriental in their imagination. In these stories, dead people, gold, and

<p class="par">When I was four years of age, my little sister Concha
died, and for the first time I cried because of love and sorrow. Till
then I had shed tears only for my own faults, which my loving, prudent
mother well knew how to correct.</p>
<p class="par">I learned to write in my own village. My father looked
after my education. He paid an old man, who had been his schoolmate, to
teach me the first steps in Latin. This teacher lived in our house till
he died, five months later. He had been in almost perfect health and it
was at the moment of death that he received extreme unction.

<p class="par">In June of 1868, I went to Manila with my father. That
was just after the birth of Trinidad, the third sister younger than
myself. We went in a casco which turned out to be a clumsy boat. I
shall not try to tell how happy I was at each new stop on the banks of
the Pasig. Beside this same river, a few years later, I was to be very
sad. We went to Cainta, Taytay, and Antipolo, and then to Manila. In
Santa Ana I visited my eldest sister, Saturnina, who at that time was a
student in La Concordia College. Then I returned to my village and
remained until 1870.</p>

<h3 class="main">My Schooling in Bi&ntilde;an</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Bi&ntilde;an is a town about one and one-half
hour&rsquo;s drive from my own town, Kalamba. My father was born in
Bi&ntilde;an, and he wished me to go there to continue the study of
Latin, which I had just begun. He sent me over one Sunday in the care
of my brother. The parting from my family was tearful on the side of my
parents and my sisters, but I was nine years old and managed to hide my
own tears. We reached Bi&ntilde;an at nightfall. We went to an
aunt&rsquo;s house where I was to live. When the moon came up, a cousin
took me around the town. Bi&ntilde;an appeared to me large and wealthy
but neither attractive nor cheerful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e834" href="#xd21e834" name="xd21e834">20</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">My brother left me after he presented me to the
schoolmaster, who, it seemed, had been his own teacher. The
schoolmaster was a tall, thin man with a long neck and a sharp nose.
His body leaned slightly forward. He wore a shirt of sinamay that had
been woven by the deft fingers of Batangas women. He knew Latin and
Spanish grammar by heart; but his severity, I believe now, was too
great. This is all that I remember of him. His classroom was in his own
house, only some thirty meters from my aunt&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p class="par">When I entered the classroom for the first time, he said
to me:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;You, do you speak Spanish?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A little, sir,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Do you know Latin?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;A little, sir,&rdquo; I again answered.</p>
<p class="par">Because of these answers, the teacher&rsquo;s son, who
was the worst boy in the class, began to make fun of me. He was some
years my elder <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e849" href="#xd21e849"
name="xd21e849">21</a>]</span>and was taller than I, yet we had a
tussle. Somehow or other, I don&rsquo;t know how, I got the better of
him. I bent him down over the class benches. Then I let him loose,
having hurt only his pride. After this, possibly because of my small
size, my schoolmates thought me a clever wrestler. On going from the
class one boy challenged me. He offered me my hold, but I lost and came
near breaking my head on the sidewalk.</p>
<p class="par">I do not want to take up time with telling about the
beatings I got, nor shall I attempt to say how it hurt when I received
the first ruler blow on my hand. I used to win in the competitions, for
no one happened to be better than I. I made the most of these
successes. But in spite of the reputation I had of being a good boy,
rare were the days in which my teacher did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e853" href="#xd21e853" name=
"xd21e853">22</a>]</span>call me up to receive five or six blows on the
hand. When I went out with my companions, they jokingly called me
nicknames. But individually they used to be so kind to me that I
thought little of their teasings. A few of them were very good and
always treated me well. Among these few was a second cousin of mine.
Later, some of them were my schoolmates in Manila and then it became my
turn to tease.</p>
<p class="par">Near the house of my teacher, Justiniano Aquin Cruz,
lived his father-in-law, generally called Juancho. Juancho was an aged
artist who let me help him with his paintings. I had already such a
liking for this art that our schoolmates called Jos&eacute; Guevarra,
another pupil, and myself the class painters. <span class=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Many of us lived in the same house. There were my
aunt, two cousins, and three half-cousins. My aunt was a very old lady,
over seventy. She used to sit on the floor and read the Bible in
Tagalog. One cousin was a maiden lady who liked very much to go to
confession and to do penances. The other cousin, her brother, was a
widower.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">One of the half-cousins was something of a tomboy. She
was quick to anger but frank and true-hearted. At times, we young folks
played in the street at night. Our elders did not permit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e873" href="#xd21e873" name=
"xd21e873">25</a>]</span>us to play in the house. The tomboy was two or
three years older than I and taught me games. She always treated me as
if I were her brother.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">My manner of life was simple. I heard mass at four if
there were a service so early, or studied my lessons at that hour and
went to mass afterwards. Then I went out in the yard and looked for
mabolos. Then came breakfast, which generally consisted of a plate of
rice and two dried sardines. There was class work till ten
o&rsquo;clock and after lunch a study period. In the afternoon, there
was school from two o&rsquo;clock until five. Next, there would be play
with my cousins for a while. Study and perhaps painting took up the
remainder of the afternoon. By and by came supper, one or two plates of
rice with a fish called <i>ayungin</i>. In the evening we had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e887" href="#xd21e887" name=
"xd21e887">26</a>]</span>prayers and then, if it was moonlight, a
cousin and I would play in the street with the others. Fortunately, I
was never ill while away from home. From time to time, I went to my own
village. How long the trip seemed going, and how short coming back!</p>
<p class="par">Many things happened which it would be tiresome to read.
Finally, there came a letter from my sister Saturnina which announced
that the steamer <i>Talim</i> would stop for me on a certain day. I
said good-bye to my numerous friends and teacher. To my teacher, I
expressed my sadness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e894" href=
"#xd21e894" name="xd21e894">27</a>]</span>in leaving and my gratitude
for his instruction. Although he had punished me frequently, he did so,
I now think, out of the kindness of his heart; and his heart was heavy
when he did it.</p>

<p class="par">I left Bi&ntilde;an on Saturday afternoon, the
seventeenth of December, 1870. I was then nine years old. For the first
time, I saw what a steamer really was. It seemed to me most beautiful
and in every way admirable. But I heard my cousin, who was with me,
make remarks to the <i lang="es">banquero</i> that were not
complimentary to her speed. I was the only passenger from Bi&ntilde;an.
Two sailors put my baggage into a cabin. Then I went to inspect it. I
thought I was going to be without a cabin-mate, but a Frenchman, Arturo
Camps, who was a friend of my father, looked after me. The journey
seemed very long, but finally we arrived at Kalamba. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e908" href="#xd21e908" name=
"xd21e908">28</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Oh! how glad I was to see the shore! At once I wanted to
jump into the first banca. A deckhand took me in his arms and put me
into the captain&rsquo;s boat. Then the Frenchman came and four sailors
rowed us ashore. It is impossible to describe my joy when I saw a
servant waiting for us with a carriage. I jumped in and soon found
myself again in our home, happy in the love of my family. Here end my
recollections of that period of mingled sadness and gladness, in which,
for the first time, I came to know anybody of foreign birth.

<p class="par">At this time, an uncle of mine, Don Jos&eacute; Alberto,
returned from Europe. He found that during his absence, his wife had
left his home and abandoned her children. The poor man anxiously sought
his wife and, at my mother&rsquo;s earnest request, he took her back.
They went to live in Bi&ntilde;an. Only a few days later the ungrateful
woman plotted with a <i>Guardia Civil</i> officer who was a friend of
ours. She accused her husband of poisoning her and charged that my
mother was an accomplice. On this charge, the alcalde sent my mother to
prison.</p>
<p class="par">I do not like to tell of the deep grief which we all,
nine sisters and brothers, felt. Our mother&rsquo;s arrest, we knew,
was unjust. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e951" href=
"#xd21e951" name="xd21e951">32</a>]</span>men who arrested her
pretended to be friends and had often been our guests. Ever since then,
child though I was, I have distrusted friendship. We learned later that
our mother, away from us all and along in years, was ill. From the
first, the <i>alcalde</i> believed the accusation. He was unfair in
every way and treated my mother rudely, even brutally. Finally, he
persuaded her to confess to what they wished by promising to set her
free and to let her see her children. What mother could resist that?
What mother would not sacrifice life itself for her children?</p>
<p class="par">They terrified and deceived my mother as they would have
any other mother. They threatened to condemn her if she did not say
what they wished. She submitted to the will of her enemies and lost her
spirit. The case <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e958" href=
"#xd21e958" name="xd21e958">33</a>]</span>became involved until the
same <i>alcalde</i> asked pardon for her. But this was only when the
matter was before the Supreme Court. He asked for the pardon because he
was sorry for what he had done. Such was his meanness that I felt
afraid of him. Attorneys Francisco de Marcaida and Manuel Masigan,
Manila&rsquo;s leading lawyers, defended my mother and they finally
succeeded in having her acquitted. They proved her innocence to her
judges, her accusers and her hosts of enemies. But after how much
delay?&mdash;After two and a half years.</p>

examinations for the secondary course in the <i>Ateneo Municipal</i>. I
arrived in Manila on June 10th, 1872. I found out for the first time
what examinations were like. My examinations were in Christian
doctrine, arithmetic and reading, in San Juan de Letran College. They
gave me a passing mark and I returned to my home. A few days later came
the celebration of the town festival, after which I went to Manila. But
even then, I felt that unhappiness was in store for me.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">As I had hoped, I was taken to the Jesuit priest
at that time in charge of the <i>Ateneo Municipal</i>. He was Father
Magin Fernando. At first he was unwilling to admit me. One reason was I
had come late. Other reasons were that I did not seem strong and was
very small for my age. I was then eleven. But later, Doctor Manuel
Xeres Burgos, a nephew of the ill-fated Padre Burgos, spoke in my
favor; and Father Fernando admitted me.</p>
<p class="par">I dressed myself in the uniform like the other students,

<p class="par">After mass, I went to the classroom. There I saw a
number of boys, Spanish, mestizos and natives, and a Jesuit teacher.
Father Jos&eacute; Bech, the teacher, was a tall man, thin and somewhat
stooping, but quick in his movements. His face was thin and pale, yet
lively. His eyes were small and sunken, his nose sharp and Grecian. His
thin lips curved downwards. He was a little eccentric, sometimes being
out of humor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1013" href="#xd21e1013"
name="xd21e1013">37</a>]</span>and intolerant; at other times amusing
himself by playing like a child.</p>
<p class="par">Some of my schoolmates were interesting enough to
warrant mentioning them by name. Florencio Gavino Oliva, a young man
from my own province, had great talent but he did not work steadily.
The same thing was true of Mois&eacute;s Santiago, a mathematician and
a penman. It was also true of Gonzalo Manzano, who then held the
position of &ldquo;Roman Emperor.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">In Jesuit colleges they divide the boys into two groups
or &ldquo;empires,&rdquo;&mdash;one Roman and the other Greek. These
two &ldquo;empires&rdquo; are always at war. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1024" href="#xd21e1024" name=
"xd21e1024">38</a>]</span>The boys of one &ldquo;empire&rdquo; always
want to outdo those of the other empire in all kinds of contests. Each
group has a leader who is called &ldquo;Emperor.&rdquo; The
&ldquo;Emperor&rdquo; wins his place by doing the best work and
standing the highest of anyone in his group. I was put at the end of
the line. I could scarcely speak Spanish, but I already understood
it.</p>
<p class="par">After the religious exercises, I went out and found my
brother waiting to take me to my lodgings, which were about twenty-five
minutes&rsquo; walk from the college. My brother did not wish to leave
me in the Walled City, which seemed very gloomy to me.</p>
<p class="par">I lodged in a small house on Calle Caraballo, near an
estero. The house consisted of a dining room, a sala, a bedroom and a
kitchen. An awning covered the small space between <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1030" href="#xd21e1030" name=
"xd21e1030">39</a>]</span>the door and the steps. My landlady was a
maiden lady called Titay, who owed our family three hundred pesos. Her
mother, a good old woman, lived with her. There were besides a crazy
woman, quite harmless, and some Spanish mestizos in the house.</p>
<p class="par">I must not speak of my sufferings, or of my troubles and
pleasures. I shall record only what happened in school during that
year. By the end of the first week, I was going up in the class. Then I
began to spend the siesta-time studying at Santa Isabel College. For
this, I paid three pesos a month. I went there with Pastor Millena, a
boy of my own age. A month later, I was &ldquo;Emperor&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="par">How pleased I was when I won my first prize, a religious
picture! In the first quarter I gained another prize, with the grade
&ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1037" href=
"#xd21e1037" name="xd21e1037">40</a>]</span>After that I did not care
to apply myself. I had foolishly become dissatisfied because of
something my teacher said. Unfortunately, this continued until the end
of the year and I gained only second place in all my subjects. This
gave me the grade of &ldquo;Excellent&rdquo; but without any prize.</p>
<p class="par">I spent the vacation at home and went with my eldest
sister, Nening, to Tanawan, for the town festival. This was in 1873.
But our pleasure was marred by the fact that our mother was not with
us. I had gone alone to see my mother without first sending word either
to her or to my father. This was at the close of the term in which I
held second place. I thought with what joy I would surprise her.
Instead, we wept in each other&rsquo;s arms. We had not seen each other
for more than a year. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1041" href=

<p class="par">After vacation was over, I returned to Manila and
enrolled in the second year. Then I hunted lodgings in the Walled City.
It was too tiring to live so far away. I found a place at 6 Calle
Magallanes in the house of an elderly widow, Do&ntilde;a Pepay. Her
daughter, also a widow, lived with her. The name of the daughter was
Do&ntilde;a Encarnaci&oacute;n, and her four sons were Jos&eacute;,
Rafael, Ignacio, and Ram&oacute;n.</p>
<p class="par">Nothing worth telling happened that year. My professor
was the same as in the previous year; but I had different schoolmates.
Among them I found three who had been with me in Bi&ntilde;an. At the
end of this year, I won a medal and returned to my town.</p>
<p class="par">I again went alone to visit my mother in prison. Like
another Joseph, I prophesied to her from a dream that her release would
take <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1048" href="#xd21e1048" name=
"xd21e1048">42</a>]</span>place within three months. This prediction
happened to come true.</p>
<p class="par">At this time, I began to devote my leisure to reading
novels. Years before, I had read one, but it was not with any great
interest. Imagine how a romantic youngster of twelve would delight in
the <i>Count of Monte Cristo</i>! Under the pretext that I should have
to study general history, I persuaded my father to buy me a set of
<span lang="es">Cesar Cantu y Di&oacute;s&rsquo;</span> histories.</p>
<p class="par">I gained much by reading them. In spite of my only half
applying myself and of my indifferent Spanish, I was able to win prizes
in the quarterly examinations. I should have gained the medal if I had
not made some slips in Spanish, which I spoke very poorly. This gave
the place to a Spanish lad who spoke his mother tongue better than I
could. Thus, then, I finished my third year. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1060" href="#xd21e1060" name=

<p class="par">When I next returned to Manila, I found my former
landlady&rsquo;s house full. I had to take a room in the house with my
brother, Paciano Mercado, in company with a boy from my town named
Quintero. My life was not so free as formerly, for I was under close
supervision. The regular hours, however, were better for me. I prayed
and played with my landlord&rsquo;s children.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="par first"><i>A portrait of General Paciano Rizal-Mercado
should appear here, but he has never had his picture taken. In
September, 1896, he was cruelly tortured in an unsuccessful endeavor to
get him to sign a statement that his brother was the leader of the
rebellion. Rizal&rsquo;s last letter, from the Fort Santiago
death-cell, tells how much the younger brother owed to the
elder</i>:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;My dear brother: Now that I am about to die, it

had my lodgings in the Walled City. The house was in Calle Solana and
belonged to a priest. My mother had not wanted me to return to Manila,
saying that I already had sufficient education. Did she have a
presentiment of what was going to happen to me? Can <span class=

<p class="par">My future profession was still unsettled. My father
wanted me to study metaphysics, so I enrolled in that course. But my
interest was so slight that I did not even buy a copy of the textbook.
A former schoolmate, who had finished his course three months before,
was my only intimate friend. He lived in the same street as I did. My
companions in the house were from Batangas and had only recently
arrived in Manila.</p>
<p class="par">On Sundays and other holidays, this friend used to call
for me and we would spend the day at my great-aunt&rsquo;s house in
Trozo. My aunt knew his father. When my youngest sister entered La
Concordia College, I used to visit <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1093" href="#xd21e1093" name="xd21e1093">46</a>]</span>her, too,
on the holidays. Another friend had a sister in the same school, so we
could go together. I made a pencil sketch of his sister from a
photograph which she lent me. On December 8th, the festival of La
Concordia, some other students and I went to the college. It was a fine
day and the building was gay with decorations of banners, lanterns and
flowers.</p>

<p class="par">Shortly after that, I went home for the Christmas
holidays. On the same steamer, was a Kalamba girl who had been a pupil
in Santa Catalina College for nearly five years. Her father was with
her. We were well acquainted but her schooling had made her bashful.
She kept her back to me while we talked. To help her pass the time, I
asked about her school and studies but I got hardly more than
&ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; in answer. She seemed to have
almost, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1104" href="#xd21e1104"
name="xd21e1104">47</a>]</span>if not entirely, forgotten her Tagalog.
When I walked into our house in Kalamba, my mother at first did not
recognize me. The sad cause was that she had almost lost her sight. My
sisters greeted me joyfully and I could read their welcome in their
smiling faces. But my father, who seemed to be the most pleased of all,
said least.</p>
<p class="par">The next day we were expecting friends from Manila to
arrive, on their way to Lipa. But the steamer landed its passengers at
Bi&ntilde;an because of a storm. So I saddled a pony and rode over
there to meet them. My horse proved to be a good traveler and when I
got back to Kalamba I rode on, by the Los Ba&ntilde;os road, to our
sugar mill. There I tied the horse by the roadside and for a time
watched the water flowing through the irrigation ditch. Its swiftness
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1108" href="#xd21e1108" name=

have always tried to live by my principles and to do the heavy duties
which I have undertaken. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1110" href=

<h2 class="main">MY FIRST READING LESSON</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">This tells how he himself became an intelligent
student. It was probably written while he was studying the schools of
Saxony. These were the models for America so that the present
educational system here is along the lines he advocated. As a child he
had written a poem, &ldquo;By Education the Fatherland Gains in
Splendor&rdquo;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I remember the time when I had not seen any other
river than the one near my town. It was as clear as crystal, and
joyous, too, as it ran on its course. But it was shaded by bamboos
whose boughs bent to every breeze as if always complaining. That was my
only world. It was bounded at the back by the blue mountains of my
province. It was bounded in front by the white surface of the lake. The
lake was as smooth as a mirror. Graceful sails were to be seen
everywhere on it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1119" href=
"#xd21e1119" name="xd21e1119">50</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">At that age, stories pleased me greatly and, with all my
soul, I believed whatever was in the books. There were good reasons why
I should. My parents told me to be very careful of my books. They urged
me to read and understand them. But they punished me for the least
lie.</p>
<p class="par">My first recollection of reciting my letters reaches
back to my babyhood. I must have been very little then, for when they
rubbed the floor of our house with banana leaves I almost fell down. I
slipped on the polished surface as beginners in skating do on ice. It
took great effort for me to climb into a chair. I went downstairs step
by step. I clung to each round of the baluster.</p>
<p class="par">In our house, as in all others in the town, kerosene oil
was unknown. I had never seen a lamp in our town, nor a carriage on our
streets. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1126" href="#xd21e1126"
name="xd21e1126">51</a>]</span>Yet I thought Kalamba was a very gay and
lively town. One night, all the family, except my mother and myself,
went to bed early. Why, I do not know, but we two remained sitting
alone. The candles had already been put out. They had been blown out in
their globes by means of a curved tube of tin. That tube seemed to me
the finest and most wonderful plaything in the world. The room was
dimly lighted by a single light of coconut oil. In all Filipino homes
such a light burns through the night. It goes out just at day-break to
awaken people by its spluttering.</p>
<p class="par">My mother was teaching me to read in a Spanish reader
called &ldquo;The Children&rsquo;s Friend.&rdquo; This was quite a rare
book and an old copy. It had lost its cover and my sister had cleverly
made a new one. She had fastened a sheet of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1130" href="#xd21e1130" name=
"xd21e1130">52</a>]</span>thick blue paper over the back and then
covered it with a piece of cloth.</p>
<p class="par">This night my mother became impatient with hearing me
read so poorly. I did not understand Spanish and so I could not read
with expression. She took the book from me. First she scolded me for
drawing funny pictures on its pages. Then she told me to listen and she
began to read. When her sight was good, she read very well. She could
recite well, and she understood verse-making, too. Many times during
Christmas vacations, my mother corrected my poetical compositions, and
she always made valuable criticisms.</p>
<p class="par">I listened to her, full of childish enthusiasm. I
marveled at the nice-sounding phrases which she read from those same
pages. The phrases she read so easily stopped me at every breath.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1136" href="#xd21e1136" name=
"xd21e1136">53</a>]</span>Perhaps I grew tired of listening to sounds
that had no meaning for me. Perhaps I lacked self-control. Anyway, I
paid little attention to the reading. I was watching the cheerful
flame. About it, some little moths were circling in playful flights. By
chance, too, I yawned. My mother soon noticed that I was not
interested. She stopped reading. Then she said to me: &ldquo;I am going
to read you a very pretty story. Now pay attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">On hearing the word &ldquo;story&rdquo; I at once opened
my eyes wide. The word &ldquo;story&rdquo; promised something new and
wonderful. I watched my mother while she turned the leaves of the book,
as if she were looking for something. Then I settled down to listen. I
was full of curiosity and wonder. I had never even dreamed that there
were stories in the old book which I read without understanding.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1140" href="#xd21e1140" name=
"xd21e1140">54</a>]</span>My mother began to read me the fable of the
young moth and the old one. She translated it into Tagalog a little at
a time.</p>
<p class="par">My attention increased from the first sentence. I looked
toward the light and fixed my gaze on the moths which were circling
around it. The story could not have been better timed. My mother
repeated the warning of the old moth. She dwelt upon it and directed it
to me. I heard her, but it is a curious thing that the light seemed to
me each time more beautiful, the flame more attractive. I really envied
the fortune of the insects. They frolicked so joyously in its
enchanting splendor that the ones which had fallen and been drowned in
the oil did not cause me any dread.</p>
<p class="par">My mother kept on reading and I listened breathlessly.
The fate of the two insects interested <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1147" href="#xd21e1147" name="xd21e1147">55</a>]</span>me
greatly. The flame rolled its golden tongue to one side and a moth
which this movement had singed fell into the oil, fluttered for a time
and then became quiet. That became for me a great event. A curious
change came over me which I have always noticed in myself whenever
anything has stirred my feelings. The flame and the moth seemed to go
farther away and my mother&rsquo;s voice sounded strange and uncanny. I
did not notice when she ended the fable. All my attention was fixed on
the fate of the insect. I watched it with my whole soul. I gave to it
my every thought. It had died a martyr to its illusions.</p>
<p class="par">As she put me to bed, my mother said: &ldquo;See that
you do not behave like the young moth. Don&rsquo;t become disobedient,
or you may get burnt as it did.&rdquo; I do not know whether
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1151" href="#xd21e1151" name=
"xd21e1151">56</a>]</span>I answered or not. I don&rsquo;t know whether
I promised anything or whether I cried. But I do remember that it was a
long time before I fell asleep. The story revealed to me things until
then unknown. Moths no longer were, for me, insignificant insects.
Moths talked; they knew how to warn. They advised, just like my mother.
The light seemed to me more beautiful. It had grown more dazzling and
more attractive. I knew why the moths circled the flame.</p>
<p class="par">The advice and warnings sounded feebly in my ears. What
I thought of most was the death of the heedless moth. But in the depth
of my heart I did not blame it. My mother&rsquo;s care had not had
quite the result she intended.</p>
<p class="par">Years have passed since then. The child has become a
man. He has crossed the most famous rivers of other countries. He has
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1157" href="#xd21e1157" name=
"xd21e1157">57</a>]</span>studied beside their broad streams. He has
crossed seas and oceans. He has climbed mountains much higher than the
Makiling of his native province, up to perpetual snow. He has received
from experience bitter lessons, much more bitter than that sweet
teaching which his mother gave him. Yet, in spite of all, the man still
keeps the heart of a child. He still thinks that light is the most
beautiful thing in creation, and that to sacrifice one&rsquo;s life for
it is worth while.</p>

lieutenant caning and injuring some unarmed and inoffensive villager.
The villager&rsquo;s only fault was that while at a distance he had not
taken off his hat and made his bow. The <i>alcalde</i> treated the poor
villagers in the same way whenever he visited us.</p>
<p class="par">We saw no restraint put upon brutality. Acts of violence

tortured any countryman with hard and cruel whips merely on suspicion.
Did they there respect the home? Or over yonder also, in order to live
in peace, would one have to bribe tyrants?</p>

your letters. Possibly, you have had to teach the letters in Spanish to
others smaller than yourself. In either case, you must have noticed
what I have, that children find great difficulty in mastering certain
syllables. These are <i>ca</i>, <i>ce</i>, <i>ci</i>, <i>co</i>,
<i>ga</i>, <i>ge</i>, <i>gua</i>, <i>gui</i>, etc. It is because
Filipino children do not understand the reasons for such
irregularities. Nor do they know the cause for the changes in value of
the sounds of certain consonants.</p>

<p class="par">In the old times, blows fell like rain. Many pupils were
whipped every day. Sometimes the schoolmaster broke the ferule and
sometimes he broke the children&rsquo;s hands. The first pages of their
primers fell to pieces from long and hard use. The children cried. Even
the monitors had to suffer at times. Yet those syllables which cost the
children so many tears are of no use to them.</p>
<p class="par">Those syllables are necessary only in the learning of
Spanish, which language in my time only three boys in a thousand ever
really learned. These three learned it in Manila, by hearing Spanish
spoken, and by committing to memory book after book. I often wondered
what was the use of learning it at all when in the end one spoke only
Tagalog. But I kept my wonder to myself. I felt that to try to make
reforms in the Philippines at that time would be to embark on a stormy
voyage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1260" href="#xd21e1260"

<p class="par">After I grew up, I had to write letters in Tagalog. I
was shocked at my ignorance of its spelling. I was surprised, too, to
find the same word spelled differently in the different works which I
consulted. This proved to me how foolish it was to try to write Tagalog
in the Spanish way. The spelling in use today by all Filipino scholars
is a great improvement over the old style. I want to place the credit
for this change where it belongs. These improvements are due to the
studies in Tagalog of Dr. T. H. Pardo de Tavera alone. I have only been
one of the most zealous champions of the change from the Spanish style.

often asked for a turkey, and my father gladly gave <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1272" href="#xd21e1272" name=
"xd21e1272">67</a>]</span>it to him. The poultry yard at our house was
always full of turkeys because my father was a fancier of these
fowls.</p>

<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">But one season there came some epidemic and almost all
the turkeys died. Only a few pairs, which were being kept for breeding,
were left. Just at this time the manager one day sent for the customary
turkey. Naturally my father had to tell the messenger that he had no
turkeys to spare, because the greater part of them had died. This reply
made the manager furiously angry. He wound up his abuse by saying,
&ldquo;You will pay for this in the end!&rdquo; A few days later my
father received a note from the manager, saying that he was going to
raise the rent on the land which my father occupied. He said the rent
would be one-third more than father was then paying. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1284" href="#xd21e1284" name=
"xd21e1284">68</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The reason for this decision was clear. It was because
my father had refused to give the manager the turkey. The proof of this
was that no other tenant received any such notice.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Father paid this increase on the day set, without a
single word of protest, being among the first to pay. But after a few
months, there came another note. In it the manager gave notice that the
rent would be doubled. This, he said, was because my father was growing
rich from the rented land where he had installed machinery for making
sugar.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">My father could not pay this price. Then he was summoned
to appear in court; and finally the <i>alcalde</i> ordered him to leave
the land. So he lost his houses and machinery, all because of a turkey.

<p class="par">On February 28th, 1888, I arrived in Yokohama. A few
moments after reaching the hotel, I received the card of the official
in charge at the Spanish legation. I had not even had a chance to brush
up when he called. He was very pleasant and offered to assist me in my
work. He even invited me to live at the legation, and I accepted. If,
at the bottom, there was a desire to watch me, I was not afraid to let
them know all about myself. I lived at the legation a little over a
month, and traveled in some of the nearby provinces of Japan. At times,
I was alone; at others, with the Spanish official himself, or with the
interpreter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1317" href="#xd21e1317"
name="xd21e1317">71</a>]</span>While there, I learned to speak
Japanese, and made a slight study of the Japanese theatre. After many
offers of employment, which I refused, I sailed at last for America,
about April 13th.</p>
<p class="par">On the steamer, I met a half-Filipino family, the wife
being a mestiza, the daughter of an Englishman named Jackson. They had
with them a servant from Pangasinan. The son asked me if I knew
&ldquo;Richal,&rdquo; the author of <i>Noli Me Tangere</i>. Smiling, I
answered that I did; and, as he began to speak well of me, I had to
make myself known and say that I was the author. The mother paid me
compliments, too. I made the acquaintance of a Japanese who was going
to Europe. He had been a prisoner for being a radical and editor of an
independent newspaper. As the Japanese spoke only Japanese, I acted as
interpreter for him until we arrived in London.</p>
<p class="par">During this voyage I was not seasick. <span class=

<p class="par">I visited the larger cities of America, where I saw
splendid buildings. The Americans have magnificent ideals. America is a
homeland for the poor who are willing to work.</p>
<p class="par">I traveled across America, and saw the majestic cascade
of Niagara. I was in New York, the great city, but there everything is
new. I went to see some relics of Washington, that great man whom I
fear has not his equal in this century.</p>
<p class="par">I embarked for Europe on the &ldquo;City of Rome&rdquo;,
said to be the second largest steamer in the world. On board, a
newspaper was published up to the end of the voyage.</p>
<p class="par">I made the acquaintance of many people. They wondered at
my taking about with me a foreigner who could not make himself
understood. The Europeans and Americans were astonished to see how I
got along with him. I could speak to every one in his own language and
understand what he said. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1335" href=

<h2 class="main">MY DEPORTATION TO DAPITAN</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">First published in the <i lang="es">Biblioteca
National Filipina, Manila</i>. The account was secretly sent by Rizal
to his friends very shortly after his arrival at his place of exile.
The reference to the school is from a letter to Doctor Blumentritt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I arrived in Manila the 26th of June, 1892. It was
on a Sunday, at 12 o&rsquo;clock, noon. A number of carbineers,
including a major, met me. A captain and a sergeant of the <i>Guardia
Veterana</i> were there in civilian clothes. I disembarked with my
luggage, and they inspected it at the custom house.</p>
<p class="par">From there, I went to the Oriente Hotel. I occupied Room
No. 22, which overlooks the Binondo Church.</p>
<p class="par">That afternoon, at four, I presented myself to His
Excellency, Governor-General Despujol. He told me to return at seven in
the evening <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1354" href="#xd21e1354"
name="xd21e1354">74</a>]</span>and I did so. He granted my petition for
the liberty of my father, but not for the liberty of my brother and
sisters. He told me to return on Wednesday evening at half past
seven.</p>
<p class="par">From there, I went to see my sisters. First I saw my
sister Narcisa, afterwards Neneng (Saturnina). On the following day,
Monday, at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, I was at the railway
station, bound for Bulacan and Pampanga. I visited Malolos, San
Fernando, and Tarlac. On the return I stopped at Bacolor, reaching
Manila on Tuesday at five o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="par">Seven-thirty on Wednesday saw me with His Excellency.
But not even then did I get him to revoke the deportation decrees.
Still he gave me hope for my sisters. As it was the festival of Saints
Peter and Paul, our interview ended at 9:15. I was to present myself on
the following day, at the same hour. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1360" href="#xd21e1360" name="xd21e1360">75</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">That day, Thursday, we spoke on unimportant matters. I
thanked him for having revoked the order to banish my sisters and told
him that my father and brother would come by the first mail-steamer. He
asked me if I wished to return to Hongkong and I answered,
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;. He told me to come again on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="par">Wednesday he asked me if I persisted in my intention of
returning to Hongkong. I told him that I did. After some conversation
he said that I had brought political circulars in my baggage. I replied
that I had not. He asked me who was the owner of the roll of pillows
and petates with my baggage. I said that they belonged to my sister. He
told me that because of them he was going to send me to Fort
Santiago.</p>
<p class="par">Don Ram&oacute;n Despujol, his nephew and aide, took me
in one of the palace carriages. At <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1367" href="#xd21e1367" name="xd21e1367">76</a>]</span>Fort
Santiago Don Enrique Villamor, the commander, received me. He assigned
me to an ordinary room containing a bed, a dozen chairs, a table, a
washstand, and a mirror. The room had three windows. One, without bars,
looked out on a court; another had bars, and overlooked the wall and
the beach; the third served also as a door and had a padlock. Two
artillerymen were on guard as sentinels. They had orders to fire on
anyone who tried to make signs from the beach. I could not talk with
anyone except the officer of the guard, and I was not allowed to
write.</p>
<p class="par">Don Enrique Villamor, the commander of the fort, gave me
books from the library.</p>
<p class="par">Each day the corporal of the guard proved to be a
sergeant. They cleaned the room every morning. For breakfast, I had
coffee with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1374" href="#xd21e1374"
name="xd21e1374">77</a>]</span>milk, a roll, and coffee-cake. Lunch was
at 12:30, and consisted of four courses. Dinner was at 8:30, and was
similar to the lunch. Commander Villamor&rsquo;s orderly waited on
me.</p>
<p class="par">On Thursday, the 14th, about 5:30 or 6 p. m., the nephew
notified me that at ten o&rsquo;clock that night I should sail for
Dapitan. I prepared my baggage, and at 10 was ready, but as no one came
to get me, I went to sleep. At 12:15, the aide arrived with the same
carriage which had brought me there. By way of the Santa Lucia gate,
they took me to the Malecon, where were General Ahumada and some other
people. Another aide and two of the <i lang="es">Guardia Veterana</i>
were waiting for me in a boat.</p>
<p class="par">The &ldquo;Cebu&rdquo; sailed in the morning at nine.
They gave me a good stateroom on the upper <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1383" href="#xd21e1383" name=
"xd21e1383">78</a>]</span>deck. Above the doors could be read
&ldquo;Chief&rdquo;. Next to my cabin was that of Capt. Delgras, who
had charge of the party.</p>
<p class="par">Ten from each branch of the military service were in the
party. There were artillery, infantry of the 70th, 71st, 72nd, 73rd,
and 74th regiments, carbineers, cavalry and engineers, and <i>Guardia
Civil</i>. Of artillerymen there were at least twelve.</p>
<p class="par">We were carrying prisoners loaded with chains, among
whom were a sergeant and a corporal, both Europeans. The sergeant was
to be shot because he had ordered his superior officer, who had
misbehaved while in Mindanao, to be tied up. The soldiers who obeyed
orders and tied the officer up were given twenty years&rsquo;
imprisonment; and the officer himself was dismissed from the service
because he had let them tie him up. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1392" href="#xd21e1392" name="xd21e1392">79</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I ate in my stateroom, the food being the same as the
officers had. I always had a sentinel and a corporal on guard. Every
night, Captain Delgras took me for a promenade on deck till 9
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p class="par">We passed along the east coast of Mindoro and the west
coast of Panay. We came to Dapitan on Sunday, at seven in the evening.
Captain Delgras and three artillerymen accompanied me in a boat rowed
by eight sailors. There was a heavy sea.</p>
<p class="par">The beach seemed very gloomy. We were in the dark,
except for our lantern, which showed a roadway grown up with weeds.</p>
<p class="par">In the town we met the governor, or commandant, Captain
Ricardo Carnicero. There was also a Spanish ex-exile, and the <i lang=
"es">practicante</i>, Don Cosme. We went to the town hall, which was a
large building.</p>

glory, but I think it is useful too. I teach reading, Spanish, English,
mathematics and geometry to the poor but intelligent boys here.
Moreover I teach them to behave like men. I have taught the men how to
get a better way of earning their living and they think I am right. We
have begun and success is crowning our trials.</p>

<div class="argument">

the education of his sisters&rsquo; children and in Germany had made
for them a translation into Tagalog of Hans Christian Andersen&rsquo;s
fairy tales. This he embellished with many appropriate drawings and
wrote out very plainly, making a book of eighty pages.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">I think that I ought to mention to you a slight
error which I have noticed in your letter. It is a little error which
many in society make.</p>
<p class="par">One should not say, &ldquo;I and my sisters greet
you,&rdquo; but &ldquo;My sisters and I greet you.&rdquo; Always you
have to put yourself last. You should say: &ldquo;Emilio and I,&rdquo;
&ldquo;You and I,&rdquo; &ldquo;My friend and I,&rdquo; and so on. For
the rest, your letter is well written. In it you express your thoughts
clearly. You use only the necessary words, and your spelling is
good.</p>

what you learn. Life is a very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1427"
href="#xd21e1427" name="xd21e1427">82</a>]</span>serious matter. It
goes well only for those who have intelligence and heart. To live is to
be among men, and to be among men is to strive.</p>
<p class="par">But this strife is not a brute-like, selfish
struggle,&mdash;nor with men alone. It is a strife with men, and at the
same time with one&rsquo;s own passions. It is a struggle with the
proprieties, with errors, with prejudices. It is a never-ending
striving, with a smile on the lips and the tears in the heart.</p>
<p class="par">On this battlefield, man has no better weapon than his
intelligence. He possesses no more force than he has spirit. Bring out
your intelligence, then, and improve it. Strengthen and educate
yourself that you may be prepared for the struggle. <span class=

<h2 class="main">MARIANG MAKILING</h2>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first">(This story is a favorite in my town.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Mariang Makiling was a young woman. She lived
somewhere on the beautiful mountain Makiling, between Laguna province
and Tayabas province. No one knew just where or how she lived. Some
said she lived in a beautiful palace surrounded by gardens. Others said
she lived in a poor hut made of nipa and bamboo.</p>
<p class="par">Maria was tall and graceful. Her color was a clear, pure
brown, <i>kayumanging kaligatan</i>, as the Tagalogs say. Her eyes were
big and black. Her hair was long and thick. Her hands and feet were
small and delicate. She was a fairy-like creature born under the
moon-beams of the Philippines. She flitted in and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1736" href="#xd21e1736" name=
"xd21e1736">94</a>]</span>out among the woods of Makiling. She was the
ruling spirit of the mountain; but she seldom came within sight of
man.</p>
<p class="par">Hunters sometimes saw Maria on the night of Good Friday
when they went out to trap deer. She would be standing motionless on
the edge of some great cliff. Her long hair floated in the wind. She
sometimes approached them. She would salute them gravely, then pass on
and disappear among the shadows of the trees. They never dared to
question her, to follow her, or to watch her.</p>
<p class="par">She liked best to appear after a storm. Then she would
scurry over the fields bringing back life to the fallen plants, and
setting everything to rights. The trees straightened up their
wind-blown trunks. The streams went back into their beds. All signs of
the storm disappeared as she passed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1742" href="#xd21e1742" name="xd21e1742">95</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Mariang Makiling had a very good heart. She used to lend
the poor country folk clothing or jewels for weddings, baptisms and
feast days. All she asked in return was a pullet as white as milk. It
had to be a <i>dumalaga</i>; that is, one that had never laid an
egg.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes she appeared as a simple country girl and
helped the poor old women to pick up firewood. Then she would slip gold
nuggets, coins and jewels into their bundles of wood.</p>
<p class="par">A hunter was one day chasing a wild boar through the
tall grass and thorny bushes. Suddenly he came to a hut in which the
animal hid. A beautiful young woman came out and said:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;The wild boar belongs to me. You have done wrong
to chase it, but I see that you are very tired. Your arms and legs are
covered with blood. Come in and eat. Then you may go on your
way.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1754" href="#xd21e1754"
name="xd21e1754">96</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The man was charmed by the beauty of the young woman. He
went in and ate everything she offered him. But he was not able to
speak a single word. Before the hunter left, the young woman gave him
some pieces of ginger. She told him to give them to his wife for her
cooking. The hunter thanked her and put the roots inside the crown of
his broad hat. On the way home his hat felt heavy. So he took out a
number of the pieces and threw them away. He was surprised and sorry
the next day when his wife discovered that what they had taken to be
ginger was solid gold. The supposed roots were bright as rays of
sunshine.</p>
<p class="par">But Mariang Makiling was not always kind and generous to
the hunters. Sometimes she punished them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1760" href="#xd21e1760" name="xd21e1760">97</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">One afternoon two hunters were coming down the mountain,
carrying some wild boars and deer which they had killed during the
day.</p>
<p class="par">They met an old woman who begged them to give her a
quarter. They thought that was too much to give, so they refused. The
old woman said that she would go and tell the mistress of those
animals, and she left them. This threat made the hunters laugh
heartily. When night had fallen and the two were near the plain, they
heard a distant shout&mdash;very distant, as though it came from the
top of the mountain:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There they go-o-o&mdash;o!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then another even more distant cry replied:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;There they go-o-o&mdash;o!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">That cry surprised both the hunters, who could not
account for it. On hearing it, the dogs stuck up their ears. They
uttered low growls <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1773" href=
"#xd21e1773" name="xd21e1773">98</a>]</span>and drew nearer to their
masters. In a few minutes the same cry was heard again, this time from
the mountain-side. On hearing it, the dogs thrust their tails between
their legs and came close to their masters. The men stared at each
other without saying a word. They were astonished that the one who
uttered the cry could travel so far in such a short time. When they
reached the plain, the fearful cry was heard again. This time, it was
so clear and distinct that both looked back. In the moonlight, they
could see two strange, gigantic shapes coming down the mountain at full
speed. Both hunters ran as fast as they could with such heavy loads.
Still the strange creatures came nearer.</p>
<p class="par">The men, coming to a spring called <i>bukal</i>, threw
down their burdens, and climbed a tree; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd21e1780" href="#xd21e1780" name="xd21e1780">99</a>]</span>and the
dogs fled toward the town. The monsters came up, and in a few seconds
devoured the wild boars and deer and went back toward the mountain.
Only then, did the hunters recover. The more courageous took aim but
his gun missed fire and the monsters escaped.</p>
<p class="par">No one ever knew whether Mariang Makiling had parents,
brothers and sisters, or other kin. Such persons spring up naturally,
like the stones the Tagalogs call <i>mutya</i>. No one ever knew her
real name. She was simply called Maria. No one ever saw her enter the
town or take part in any religious ceremony. She remained ever the
same. The five or six generations that knew her always saw her young,
fresh, sprightly, and pure.</p>
<p class="par">For many years now no one has seen her on Makiling. Her
vapor figure no longer wanders <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd21e1789"
href="#xd21e1789" name="xd21e1789">100</a>]</span>through the deep
valleys. It no longer hovers over the waterfall on the serene moonlight
nights. The melancholy tone of her mysterious harp is no longer heard.
Now lovers are married without getting from her either jewels or
presents. Mariang Makiling has disappeared.</p>
<p class="par">Some blame the people of a certain town who not only
refused to give her the customary white pullet but even failed to
return the jewels and clothing borrowed. Others say that Mariang
Makiling is offended because some landlords are trying to take half of
the mountain.</p>

first prize and the Economic Society of the Friends of the Country gave
the winner a diploma of merit. Rizal&rsquo;s allegory, &ldquo;The
Council of the Gods&rdquo; was preferred by the judges, all Spaniards.
But when the envelopes containing the contestants&rsquo; names were
opened, there was objection to giving first prize to a Filipino when
prominent Spaniards had taken part in the contest. Rizal says that he
was hissed off the stage when he appeared in answer to the reading of
his name. Manila newspapers of that period dared not speak of the
incident openly but there were several veiled allusions to it. One
writer sarcastically said that medical students should be forbidden to
write poetry<span class="corr" id="xd21e2340" title=

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
